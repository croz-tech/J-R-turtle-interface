# J-R-turtle-interface
Re-creation of the Jessop-Ralph turtle interface for the BBC Micro range of home computers.

Connects to the BBC Micro user port (20 way IDC) and the turtle via a 15 way D connector.
Requires a +5V stabilised power supply which can be taken from the BBC Micro's aux power output.  However this is often used for disk drives, therefore a seperate power supply can be used.  Interface and turtle are comatible with Acornsoft Logo (using the JESSOP) extension.  It can also be used with DART software or driven directly via user port commands.
